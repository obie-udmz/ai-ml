### Bit-Gypsy, AI ML Based Bitcoin Price Prediction Web Application (link to application: https://bytgypsy-app.herokuapp.com/)
This Web application exploits time-series forecasting methods to predict the price of Bitcoin, using machine learning. Organizations, markets and industries are daily in need of the ability to accurately predict the performance of their value drivers, and time-series forecasting leveraging on machine learning algorithms have made this possible.
Although cryptocurrencies have been tagged by financial experts as the future of transactions, Bitcoin, which is the most popular and acceptable cryptocurrency has a very volatile price trend, making it challenging for this method of transaction to gain the trust of its users. By providing accurate predictions of Bitcoin prices, we intend increasing the trust of both those who simply use cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions or investors seeking to make profits from Bitcoin as every other money market.
I chose to tackle a time-series challenge as we believe that the approach can be easily replicated by various organizations operating in diverse sectors.

### Chatbot and Sentiment Analysis, AI ML Based Intelligent Customer Support and Feedback System (web app link can be provided if required)
The e-commerce industry is a fast paced, highly competitive and continuously growing space requiring businesses operating within the industry to maintain a high customer engagement and satisfaction level. An online retailer have been able to identify a major problem they are faced with, which is keeping up with customer engagement especially in the area of providing customer support, enquiry tickets resolution and feedback. The problem of keeping up with customer engagement can be clearly stated on a finer level as: the low engagement rates witnessed when using email-based feedback channels, the 'mechanical' seeming customer support systems often built on just archives of frequently asked questions, the support systems lacking in the ability of determining the emotional sentiment of the customer, the relatively slower time it takes for the  support staff to resolve a backlog of enquiry ticket which is very costly for this fast paced industry, the low customer experience rating as a result of customers being unable to reach support staff during peak business times, and the high cost of running the customer support centers after regular business hours, weekends and public holidays; this system (comprising of two modules - sentiment analysis module and chatbot module) aims at  helping the selected company improve its current business processes by using a machine learning classifier to identify and group customers' words that express sentiments, making it easy for quicker resolutions according to the current business priorities. Also, the chatbot module helps to quickly respond to customers' enquiries.

I have a good understanding of the key aspects of an AI/ML pipeline as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Pre-processing (Data cleaning, Feature Selection and Feature Engineering), Model selection, Modeling and Model Evaluation; tackling problem areas as Forecasting/Regression, Categorization/Classification, Natural Language Processing,  and Image recognition. I have developed AI/ML solutions for client organizations in healthcare, retail, technology, legal, tourism, government, and finance sectors.

I am also skilled in data analysis, data visualization and reporting, and I have included samples of dashboards and reports I have designed to support business decision making.
